Starter application template using [Piccolo ORM](https://piccolo-orm.com/) ecosystem (with [Litestar](https://litestar.dev/) framework) as backend and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as frontend.

The template includes several useful things such as user authentication, user management (with user profile and crud dashboard), admin UI and more.
